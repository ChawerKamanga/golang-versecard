# Go VerseCardAPI

Hey there, so this project is all about letting people request a personalized email with their favorite Bible verse in it. You give it your name, email, and the specific verse you want, and it generates a fancy email with the verse and a cool background image. It uses [GetBible](https://query.getbible.net/) to make sure the verses are accurate and [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) to find pretty pictures.
